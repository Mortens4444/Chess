# Chess
This is a virtual chessboard.

You can open **Light.html** or **Dark.html** in your browser.

There is a **light_state.js** and a **dark_state.js** file in the project. You can set up any of these, currently, it uses the light_state.js,
but you can change it any time in the chessboard.js first line.

There are some limitations of the program.
It won't validate any of your moves, so you can freely play around.
