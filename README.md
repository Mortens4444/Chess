# Chess
This is a virtual chessboard.

You can open **Light.html**, **Dark.html** or **Both.html** in your browser.

There is a **lightState.js** and a **darkState.js** file in the project.
The **Light.html** loads **lightState.js** by default, 
the **Dark.html** loads **darkState.js** by default,
but you can change this at chessBoardBuilder.js file.

There are some limitations of the program.
It won't validate any of your moves, so you can freely play around.
